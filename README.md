# chrome-extention-sandbox
Here we are playing around and learning how to create a Chrome Extension.

## Goal of Project
The goal is learn, how one creates a Chrome extension. Let's create a simple 
plugin, that can parse predefined HTML page and extract required data from it.
The HTML page should contain a table with the following fields:  
- ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Details: a link that user can click to see the personal info of the person as
a pop-up.

The details popup should contain the following fields:
- ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Phone Number

Let's create a Chrome Extension, that would allow to search records by name
(first + last name), email and phone number.
